# PcloudKmerClusters

Python package for implementing p-cloud clustering, and annotation to genome. It follows implementation done by Prof. David Pollock.


- Installation

Install the code from github: `git clone git@github.com:rlesiyon/PcloudKmerClusters.git && cd PcloudKmerClusters`

I switched to using Poetry for dependencies maintainance. You can have a look at poetry here: https://python-poetry.org/docs/

Install poetry: `pipx install poetry`
Required python: `>=3.13`

Navigate to the src, and run cli.py command to generate a plot showing distributions of p-clouds across the genome.
